[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aetheon/js-utils.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aetheon/js-utils)

> **It's not a library! Is a collection of javascript AMD modules to be reused.** 
> It's meant to be used using require.js or a r.js bundle. (TODO: use case example's)

> Was born because I got tired of writing the same code between projects.

> There are helper, best practices, data structures, and a lot of code. 

> Some code have dependencies to 3rd party framework to provide extra feature's.

> Uses Jasmine.js / Jasmine.async.js / Squire to test the code. Each module has it's own Spec file.
